- 👋 Hi, I’m @benmckq
- 👀 I’m interested in Python scripting, automation, webscraping, blockchain, and data mining
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about mathematical finance, Solidity programming, and various different Python libraries to help with automation and webscraping
- 💞️ I’m currently working on a sports betting algorithm for finding arbitrage opportunities and other profitable strategies. I'm also looking to collaborate on any other automation or data science projects, so please reach out!
